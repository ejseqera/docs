Each workspace has a Launchpad that allows users to easily create and share Nextflow pipelines that can be executed on any infrastructure supported by the Platform, including all public clouds and most HPC schedulers. A Launchpad pipeline consists of a pre-configured workflow repository, compute environment, and launch parameters.

Users can create their own pipelines, share them with others on the Launchpad, or add over a hundred community pipelines available from nf-core and other sources.

See [Add pipelines](./add-pipeline.mdx) to learn how to add pipelines to your own workspaces.

## Launch the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline

Navigate to the Launchpad in the `seqeralabs/showcase` workspace and select **Launch** next to the `nf-core-rnaseq` pipeline to open the launch form.

### Nextflow parameter schema

When you select **Launch**, a parameters page allows you to fine-tune the pipeline execution. This parameters form is rendered from a [`nextflow_schema.json`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/nextflow_schema.json) file in the root of the pipeline Git repository. `nextflow_schema.json` is a simple JSON-based schema describing pipeline parameters for pipeline developers to easily adapt their in-house Nextflow pipelines to be executed via Seqera Platform.

See [Best Practices for Deploying Pipelines with the Seqera Platform](https://seqera.io/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-pipelines-with-seqera-platform/) to learn how to automatically build the parameter schema for any Nextflow pipeline using tooling maintained by the nf-core community. 

### Parameter selection

Adjust the following Platform-specific options if needed:

- `Workflow run name`: A unique identifier for the run, pre-filled with a random name. This can be customized.
- `Labels`: Assign new or existing labels to the run. For example, Project ID or genome version.

Each pipeline has a set of parameters that need to be provided in order to run it. The following parameters are mandatory:

- `input`:

    Most nf-core pipelines use the `input` parameter in a standardized way to specify an input samplesheet that contains paths to any input files (such as FastQ files) and any additional metadata required to run the pipeline. The `input` parameter can accept a file path to a samplesheet in the S3 bucket selected through Data Explorer (such as `s3://my-bucket/my-samplesheet.csv`). Alternatively, the Seqera Platform has a **Datasets** feature that allows you to upload structured data (like samplesheets) for use with Nextflow pipelines.

    Select **Browse** next to the `input` parameter to search and select a pre-loaded dataset called `rnaseq_sample_data`.

    See [Add datasets](./add-datasets.mdx) to upload your own samplesheets in the **Datasets** tab of your workspace.

- `outdir`:

    Most nf-core pipelines use the `outdir` parameter in a standardized way to specify where the final results created by the pipeline are published. `outdir` must be unique for each pipeline run. Otherwise, your results will be overwritten. To publish these files to an S3 bucket, provide the directory path to the appropriate storage location (such as `s3://my-bucket/my-results`).

    For the `outdir` parameter, specify an S3 directory path manually, or select **Browse** to specify a cloud storage directory using Data Explorer.

Modify and specify other parameters to customize the pipeline execution through the parameters form. For example, in the **Read trimming options** section, change the `trimmer` to select `fastp` in the dropdown menu instead of `trimgalore`, then select **Launch**.
