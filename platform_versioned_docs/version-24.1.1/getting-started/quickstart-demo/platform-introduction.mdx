Seqera Platform is an intuitive, centralized command post designed to make scientific analysis accessible at any scale. 

Platform acts as a pane of glass to effortlessly launch, manage, monitor, and collaborate on scalable Nextflow data analysis using your own computing resources and infrastructure. Researchers can focus on the science that matters, rather than worrying about infrastructure engineering.

Seqera helps organizations:

- Launch, manage, and monitor portable Nextflow pipelines from anywhere in real-time
- Enable non-technical users to run pipelines via the intuitive Launchpad interface
- Easily provision and leverage cloud-based compute environments
- Share pipelines and data and collaborate securely between local and remote teams
- Easily access libraries of production-proven Nextflow community pipelines available from [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)
- Automate complex tasks as part of broader enterprise processes

## Deployment methods

Seqera offers two deployment methods:

- **Seqera Cloud**: A version of the application available as a SaaS solution, hosted on Seqera's infrastructure.
- **Seqera Enterprise**: A lightweight, deployable version of the application hosted on your own infrastructure.

## Core components

Platform consists of three main architectural components: a backend container, a frontend container, and a database that stores all of the data required by the application. The frontend container communicates with the backend container and database via API calls. As a result, all features and activities available through the user interface can also be accessed programmatically via the Seqera Platform API and tw CLI. For more information, see [Automation](./014_automation_on_the_seqera_platform.md).

This walkthrough will demonstrate the various features of Seqera Platform that make it easier to build, launch, and manage scalable data pipelines.

## Access Platform

Log in to [Seqera Cloud](https://cloud.seqera.io/login) with your GitHub or Google account, or by providing an email address. If you are signing in for the first time, Seqera Cloud will send an authentication link to the email address to enable login.

Upon your first login, you arrive in `community/showcase`, a demonstration workspace in the Seqera organization. The Showcase contains all the resources needed to follow this guide.

- To begin launching Showcase pipelines, see [Launch pipelines](./launch-pipelines.mdx).
- To skip the Showcase and begin adding your own pipelines and resources, see [Start collaborating](../start-collaborating.mdx) to first create your own organizations and workspaces.
