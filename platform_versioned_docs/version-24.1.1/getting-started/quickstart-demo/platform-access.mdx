## Organizations and workspaces

All resources in Seqera are managed within organizations, typically named after your organization. An organization can contain multiple workspaces. Each workspace is an isolated environment that can consists of different users, pipelines, credentials and compute infrastructure. Workspaces enable user access to the Platform depending on your organizational needs. Typically, teams of colleagues or collaborators will have access to one or more workspaces, and all resources in a workspace (pipelines, compute environments, datasets, etc.) are shared among workspace members.

With workspaces, organization owners can:

- Help research teams segment their work depending on their needs.
- Enable teams to focus on specific activities that need to be kept secure, such as core R&D or clinical trials with PII.
- Create workspaces for specific internal departments like oncology, neuroscience, or therapeutics.
- Add organization users to workspaces, individually or in teams.

Upon your first login, you arrive in `seqeralabs/showcase`, a demonstration workspace in the Seqera organization. The Showcase contains all the resources needed to complete this guide.

To begin launching Showcase pipelines, see [Launch pipelines](./launch-pipelines.mdx).
To skip the Showcase and begin adding your own pipelines and resources, see [Start collaborating](../start-collaborating.mdx) to first create your own organizations and workspaces.
