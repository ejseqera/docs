# Seqera Pipelines

Seqera Pipelines is a list of the best open-source Nextflow workflows. Finding high quality pipelines is critical, so we’ve created a tightly curated list of the very best workflows to begin with.

Every pipeline comes with curated test data, so you can import into Seqera Platform and launch a test run in just a few clicks:

The pipeline details page provides key information about the workflow. With one click, you can add pipelines to your Seqera Platform Launchpad.

Simply click the **Launch** button, specify whether you would like to add the pipeline to a Cloud or Enterprise instance, and provide your Platform user access token.

You can then select the organization, workspace, and compute environment for the pipeline.

Select the **Launch Pipeline** tab to see various methods for launching the pipeline.

If you’re more at home in the terminal, you can use the launch box to grab commands for Nextflow, [Seqera Platform CLI](014_automation_on_the_seqera_platform.md), and [nf-core/tools](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools).

Search for pipelines by name, or filter the list by **Organization** or use case-specific **Keywords**. 

 then select **Launch** to either add the pipeline to your workspace or launch it directly with the provided CLI commands. From the **Add pipeline** tab, specify whether you would like to add the pipeline to a Cloud or Enterprise instance, and provide your Platform user access token. Select **Get your access token from Seqera Platform** if you do not have it handy already. 

Next, select the organization, workspace, and compute environment for the pipeline. You can also customize the pipeline name and description before selecting **Add pipeline** to add it to your chosen workspace.
